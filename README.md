Java Lightweight Component Framework Example applications

This repository contains the examples for the JLCF framework.

The Java Light Component Framework (JLCF) is a framework for developing modular applications for the java language. It allows designing an application using building blocks with well-defined inputs and outputs (aka software components). Using this well-defined modular approach, the application has a clear and explicit design which facilitates the development and maintenance of a software system.

JLCF focuses on usability on a simple programming model and also provides advanced features such as interceptors, callbacks and dynamic component replacement.
